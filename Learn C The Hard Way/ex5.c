1.For each line, write out the symbols you don't understand and see if you can guess what they mean. Write a little chart on paper with your guess that you can use to check later and see if you get it right.
2.Go back to the source code from the previous exercises and do a similar break-down to see if you're getting it. Write down what you don't know and can't explain to yourself.
